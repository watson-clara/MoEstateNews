# MoEstateNews

Hey! This is MoEstateNews, which is a this Next.js app I built (well, mostly built some is mocked) for the MoFlo Cloud projct. It's supposed to help real estate people make briefs automatically using AI.

## a. What This Does 

This app helps real estate people make briefs without having to do all the manual work. Here's what it's supposed to do:

1. **Scrapes Data Automatically** - Right now it just uses mock data from county permits, MLS listings, and sales records. 

2. **AI Picks the Good Data** - The AI (mock) automatically picks 5-8 data points from all the scraped sites. I made it prioritize sales > MLS > permits because sales seemed more important? I think?

3. **Sorts by Property Type** - You can pick office, retail, industrial, multifamily, or all of them. It groups everything together which is nice.

4. **Makes Content** - It generates titles and writes 2-3 paragraph summaries for each deal. 

5. **Exports** - When you save a brief it automatically downloads as a JSON text file. 

**The User Flow:** Person picks property type and time span, clicks the generate button, then gets a brief. No manual research needed! 

## b. How to Set It Up (Hopefully)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher 
- npm or pnpm or yarn (I used npm)

### Setup Steps

1. **Go to the folder:**
   ```bash
   cd moestate-news
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This might take a minute. Lots of packages.

4. **Run it:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open it:**
   Go to [http://localhost:3000/moestate-news](http://localhost:3000/moestate-news) in your browser.

That should work! If it doesn't, check the console for errors. 

## c. Key Features (The Good Parts)

### The AI Generation Thing
- **Fully Automatic** - You literally just pick property type and time span, that's it!!
- **No Manual Selection** - The code picks what to include automatically 
- **Selects Relevant Stuff** - It picks like 5-8 data points based on property type and how recent they are
- **Makes Content** - Generates titles and summaries automatically. 
- **Comparables** - Finds similar properties but honestly this might need work. It just checks if size is similar.

### Data Sources (All Mocked Right Now)
- **County Permits** - Building permits, renovations, construction stuff. Has permit numbers, values, descriptions.
- **MLS Feeds** - Listings, pending sales, sold properties. Has prices, square footage, status.
- **Public Sales Records** - Transactions with buyer/seller info, prices, dates, parcel numbers.

### Property Types
- Office
- Retail  
- Industrial
- Multifamily
- All (combines everything)

### Management Stuff
- **Grid & Table Views** - Switch between cards and a table. Table view is probably better if you have a lot.
- **Filtering** - Search by title/content and filter by time. The search is case-insensitive which is nice.
- **Sorting** - Sort by newest, oldest, or alphabetically
- **Edit & Delete** - You can edit briefs or delete them. 
- **Export** - Downloads as JSON text file automatically when you save
- **Stats** - Shows how many briefs you have and how many data points. 

### Pages
- **Landing Page** (`/moestate-news`) - Shows recent briefs and explains what it does
- **Create Page** (`/moestate-news/create`) - Simple form, just property type and time span
- **View Page** (`/moestate-news/view`) - Manage all your briefs, filter, sort, etc.

## d. Assumptions & Limitations (The Reality Check)

### Assumptions I Made

1. **The AI is Fake** - It's not real AI. It's just templates and some basic logic. It just picks data and formats it. We can implement this later.

2. **All Data is Mocked** - The permits, MLS listings, and sales records are all hardcoded in `lib/data-sources.ts`. In real life you'd need:
   - API access to county permit databases (probably need API keys)
   - MLS system integration (might need membership/credentials)
   - Public records APIs (might need county-level agreements)

3. **localStorage by Default** - Data saves in your browser. Doesn't sync across devices. If you clear cache it's gone. There's Supabase support but you have to set it up yourself.

4. **Single User** - No login system. No multi-user stuff. Just one person using it per browser.

5. **Local Development** - Made for local development. Not really production-ready but it works for demos.

### Limitations (Things That Don't Work Great)

1. **No Real APIs** - Everything is mocked. Would need actual integrations for production.

2. **Simplified AI** - Content generation uses templates. Selection is just rule-based. Comparable matching is basic (within 50% size). No machine learning.

3. **RSS Parsing is Placeholder** - The RSS feed stuff in `lib/rss.ts` doesn't really work. Would need a library like `rss-parser` but I didn't add it.

4. **Browser-Only Storage** - localStorage doesn't sync. Data can be lost. Supabase exists but isn't required.

5. **Error Handling Could Be Better** - There's basic error handling but some edge cases might break things. Network failures might not be handled well. I tried to catch errors but might have missed some.

6. **No Authentication** - Anyone can use it. No security. All data is local per browser.

7. **Comparables Are Basic** - Just checks size similarity. Doesn't account for location, condition, amenities, etc. Could be way better.

8. **English Only** - No translations or internationalization stuff.

9. **Fixed Data Volume** - Always picks max 8 data points. 

10. **Export Format** - Downloads as .txt file with JSON inside. 

### Things You'd Need for Production

If someone actually wanted to use this in production, you'd need:
- Real API integrations (county, MLS, sales records)
- Actual AI/LLM service (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- User authentication
- Real database 
- Better error handling
- Rate limiting
- Caching
- Background jobs for scraping
- Email capabilities maybe?
- PDF export would be nice

But for now it's a working demo that shows the concept!

## Running Commands

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Build for production 
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Lint 
npm run lint
```

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router) - The framework
- TypeScript - Type safety (kinda)
- Tailwind CSS - Styling
- Zod - Validation
- Supabase (optional) - Database if you want it
- React Context - State management
- localStorage - Default storage

## Usage Example

1. Go to `/moestate-news/create`
2. Pick "Office" as property type
3. Pick "Weekly" as time span
4. Wait like 1 second for the "AI" to work
5. Review the generated brief (it auto-generates)
6. Click "Save Brief" - downloads as text file
7. Go to `/moestate-news/view` to see all your briefs

That's it! No manual work needed because everything is automated (mocked).

## Final Notes

 It's not perfect and a lot of it is mocked, but it demonstrates the concept! The code might have some issues and the logic could be better, but it works for a demo. If you want to make it production-ready, you'd need to add real APIs, real AI, better error handling, auth, etc.
