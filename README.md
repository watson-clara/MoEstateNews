# MoEstateNews

Hey! So this is MoEstateNews, which is like this Next.js app I built (well, mostly built) for the MoFlo Cloud thing. It's supposed to help real estate people make these briefs automatically using AI, but fair warning - most of it is mocked right now. Like the AI part is totally fake, it's just templates and stuff. But it looks real!

## a. What This Does (I Think)

Okay so basically this app helps real estate people make briefs without having to do all the manual work. Here's what it's supposed to do:

1. **Scrapes Data Automatically** - Or it would if we had real APIs. Right now it just uses mock data from county permits, MLS listings, and sales records. In real life you'd need to hook up to actual databases but that's like... way more complicated.

2. **AI Picks the Good Stuff** - The "AI" (which is really just some logic I wrote) automatically picks 5-8 data points from all the stuff it finds. It tries to get variety and recent stuff. I made it prioritize sales > MLS > permits because sales seemed more important? I think?

3. **Sorts by Property Type** - You can pick office, retail, industrial, multifamily, or all of them. It groups everything together which is nice.

4. **Makes Content** - It generates titles and writes like 2-3 paragraph summaries for each deal. The summaries are pretty basic but they have prices and square footage and stuff. There's also this comparable feature that finds similar properties but it's kind of simple - just checks if size is within 50% which might not be perfect.

5. **Exports Stuff** - When you save a brief it automatically downloads as a JSON text file. Not sure if that's the best format but it works.

**The User Flow:** Person picks property type and time span, clicks a button, waits like 1 second while the "AI" pretends to work, then gets a brief. No manual research needed! (Well, no manual research because it's all fake data, but you get the idea.)

## b. How to Set It Up (Hopefully)

Okay so here's what you need to do:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher (I think? That's what package.json says)
- npm or pnpm or yarn (I used npm)

### Setup Steps

1. **Go to the folder:**
   ```bash
   cd moestate-news
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This might take a minute. Lots of packages.

3. **Environment stuff (optional):**
   If you want to use Supabase (which is optional), you'd need to create a `.env.local` file with your credentials. But you don't need it - it works fine with just localStorage. The database stuff is there if you want it later though.

4. **Run it:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open it:**
   Go to [http://localhost:3000/moestate-news](http://localhost:3000/moestate-news) in your browser.

That should work! If it doesn't, check the console for errors. There might be some TypeScript errors but those are usually fine to ignore for now.

## c. Key Features (The Good Parts)

### The AI Generation Thing
- **Fully Automatic** - You literally just pick property type and time span, that's it
- **No Manual Selection** - The code picks what to include automatically (well, it tries to)
- **Selects Relevant Stuff** - It picks like 5-8 data points based on property type and how recent they are
- **Makes Content** - Generates titles and summaries automatically. The summaries are kind of template-y but they work.
- **Comparables** - Finds similar properties but honestly this might need work. It just checks if size is similar.

### Data Sources (All Mocked Right Now)
- **County Permits** - Building permits, renovations, construction stuff. Has permit numbers, values, descriptions.
- **MLS Feeds** - Listings, pending sales, sold properties. Has prices, square footage, status.
- **Public Sales Records** - Transactions with buyer/seller info, prices, dates, parcel numbers.

### Property Types
- Office
- Retail  
- Industrial
- Multifamily
- All (combines everything)

### Management Stuff
- **Grid & Table Views** - Switch between cards and a table. Table view is probably better if you have a lot.
- **Filtering** - Search by title/content and filter by time. The search is case-insensitive which is nice.
- **Sorting** - Sort by newest, oldest, or alphabetically
- **Edit & Delete** - You can edit briefs or delete them. The edit page is kind of different from create.
- **Export** - Downloads as JSON text file automatically when you save
- **Stats** - Shows how many briefs you have and how many data points. Not super useful but it's there.

### Pages
- **Landing Page** (`/moestate-news`) - Shows recent briefs and explains what it does
- **Create Page** (`/moestate-news/create`) - Simple form, just property type and time span
- **View Page** (`/moestate-news/view`) - Manage all your briefs, filter, sort, etc.

The UI is responsive I think? I tested it on desktop mostly but it should work on mobile too.

## d. Assumptions & Limitations (The Reality Check)

### Assumptions I Made

1. **The AI is Fake** - Like, it's not real AI. It's just templates and some basic logic. No LLM calls or anything. It just picks data and formats it. If you want real AI you'd need to hook up OpenAI or something and that costs money.

2. **All Data is Mocked** - The permits, MLS listings, and sales records are all hardcoded in `lib/data-sources.ts`. In real life you'd need:
   - API access to county permit databases (probably need API keys)
   - MLS system integration (might need membership/credentials)
   - Public records APIs (might need county-level agreements)
   - All of that sounds complicated so I just made fake data.

3. **localStorage by Default** - Data saves in your browser. Doesn't sync across devices. If you clear cache it's gone. There's Supabase support but you have to set it up yourself.

4. **Single User** - No login system. No multi-user stuff. Just one person using it per browser.

5. **Local Development** - Made for local development. Not really production-ready but it works for demos.

6. **Simple Selection Logic** - The "AI selection" just prioritizes diversity and recency. It's not actually intelligent, it's just some if statements and loops.

### Limitations (Things That Don't Work Great)

1. **No Real APIs** - Everything is mocked. Would need actual integrations for production.

2. **Simplified AI** - Content generation uses templates. Selection is just rule-based. Comparable matching is basic (within 50% size). No machine learning.

3. **RSS Parsing is Placeholder** - The RSS feed stuff in `lib/rss.ts` doesn't really work. Would need a library like `rss-parser` but I didn't add it.

4. **Browser-Only Storage** - localStorage doesn't sync. Data can be lost. Supabase exists but isn't required.

5. **Error Handling Could Be Better** - There's basic error handling but some edge cases might break things. Network failures might not be handled well. I tried to catch errors but might have missed some.

6. **No Authentication** - Anyone can use it. No security. All data is local per browser.

7. **Comparables Are Basic** - Just checks size similarity. Doesn't account for location, condition, amenities, etc. Could be way better.

8. **English Only** - No translations or internationalization stuff.

9. **Fixed Data Volume** - Always picks max 8 data points. The selection algorithm is deterministic, not really "intelligent."

10. **Export Format** - Downloads as .txt file with JSON inside. Not sure if that's the best format but it works for now.

### Things You'd Need for Production

If someone actually wanted to use this in production, you'd need:
- Real API integrations (county, MLS, sales records)
- Actual AI/LLM service (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- User authentication
- Real database (Supabase or something)
- Better error handling
- Rate limiting
- Caching
- Background jobs for scraping
- Email capabilities maybe?
- PDF export would be nice

But for now it's a working demo that shows the concept!

## Running Commands

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Build for production (probably won't work great)
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Lint (might have errors)
npm run lint
```

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router) - The framework
- TypeScript - Type safety (kinda)
- Tailwind CSS - Styling
- Zod - Validation
- Supabase (optional) - Database if you want it
- React Context - State management
- localStorage - Default storage

## Usage Example

1. Go to `/moestate-news/create`
2. Pick "Office" as property type
3. Pick "Weekly" as time span
4. Wait like 1 second for the "AI" to work
5. Review the generated brief (it auto-generates)
6. Click "Save Brief" - downloads as text file
7. Go to `/moestate-news/view` to see all your briefs

That's it! No manual work needed because everything is automated (and fake, but automated fake stuff is still automated).

## Final Notes

So yeah, this is what I built. It's not perfect and a lot of it is mocked, but it demonstrates the concept. The code might have some issues and the logic could be better, but it works for a demo. If you want to make it production-ready, you'd need to add real APIs, real AI, better error handling, auth, etc. But for showing how it would work, this is fine I think.

Let me know if something breaks! I tried to test it but might have missed things.
