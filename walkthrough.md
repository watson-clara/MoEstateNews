# MoEstateNews Walkthrough - Screenshot Explanations

These screenshots show how the app works. I took them in order while going through the workflow. Here's what each one shows:

## Landing Page
![Landing Page](./media/landing.png)

This is the main landing page at `/moestate-news`. This is where users land first. It's pretty straightforward just explains what the app does and gives quick access to create or manage briefs.

## Create Page

![Create1](./media/create1.png)

This is the create page at `/moestate-news/create`. At this point nothing is filled in yet.

![Create2](./media/create2.png)

Use the dropdown menu to select property type.

![Create3](./media/create2.png)

Next select the time span that you wnat the breif to cover. 

![Create4](./media/create4.png)

If you scroll down the page will automatically fill out the breif after the drop downs are filled out. 

![Create5](./media/create5.png)

Click the save button and the breif will automtically download. 

## Manage Page

![View Page Grid](./media/manage1.png)

This is the view page at `/moestate-news/view`. This is the main management interface. Grid view shows briefs as cards which is nice for browsing.


![View Page Table](./media/manage2.png)

Table view is better when you have a lot of briefs and want to see them in a more compact list format.

![Delete](./media/manage3.png)

If you want to delete an entry you must click okay.

## Edit Page

You can access this page by clicking the blue edit button on the manage page.

![Edit Page](./media/edit1.png)

This is the edit page (probably `/moestate-news/create?id=something`). This is how users edit existing briefs.
